This repository is for maintaining some of the fun Arduino/breadboard circuit projects I have worked on. If you have any questions concerning any of these projects, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:jwoolard@augusta.edu).



## The ANNOYING Alarm Clock

I built a VERY annoying alarm clock that will randomly pick one of several devious methods in order to turn it off. The idea here being that if you need help waking up in the morning (like I do) then this device will surely wake you up! Here is a <a href="https://augustauniversity.box.com/s/8mynia4jhz0b2glyzlw841ffj8upu7dv" target="_blank">video demonstration and explanation</a> of the device and how it works.



## Tello Arduino

For the Augusta University Electronics Club, I built a flight drone controller that would be useful for navigating flight drones through obstacle courses using breadboard circuits. These circuits incorporated various controller schemes like a <a href="https://augustauniversity.box.com/s/2o95k9wt9aztsvihuy4ym588gdthlfxn" target="_blank">push button controller</a> and a <a href="https://augustauniversity.box.com/s/yi3ry78jbvrc01hjwyxsr6tfrlpo66zu" target="_blank">joystick controller</a> (links to respective video demonstrations).
